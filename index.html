            <h1>The Moral Decisions of Self-Driving Cars</h1>
            <p> AI in vehicles is becoming more prominent throughout the world, it is happening very quickly
                 and with it comes many problems and decisions that are required to be dealt with before they 
                 become more mainstream. Ethics in self-driving cars is a huge area that needs to be discussed 
                 as we are only just realising how split the world really is on these moral decisions around
