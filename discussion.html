            <p>A survey of 2.3 million people worldwide reveals variations in the moral principles that guide 
                drivers' decisions. Respondents were presented with 13 scenarios, in which a collision that killed 
                some combination of passengers and pedestrians was unavoidable, and asked to decide who they would spare.
                Scientists used these data to group countries and territories into three groups based on their moral attitudes.</p>
            <p>It Is very difficult for us to make these decisions ourselves let 
                alone universally agree on these decisions, so how can we expect 
                artificial intelligence in self-driving cars to make these decisions 
                without us? Studies like this one are incredibly valuable for the 
                future as they give us information that will help bring in regulations, 
                the world cannot be this split on such life or death decisions. A 
                conversation is required along with more studies to find out the best 
                route to take for the future of artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.</p>
